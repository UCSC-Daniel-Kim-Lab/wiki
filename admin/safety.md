### Waste management

When biosafety waste is full, remove the bag and double bag the waste. DO NOT tie the waste bags, leave an opening for gas to escape.

For glassware, rinse with bleach and run through the dishwasher in the autoclave room before running. Run on cycle 3.

Place the waste in the secondary containment on the 4C fridge, and bring to the autoclave. Rotate the hatch until it resists then do 1 more full turn. Run the autoclave on sterilize for 45 minutes and enter your name on the log sheet by the door. Remove the waste after an hour to give it time to cool.
